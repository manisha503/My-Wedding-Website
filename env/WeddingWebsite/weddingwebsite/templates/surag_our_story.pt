  <h3 class="story_heading">How We Met</h3>
  <div>
  Rishi and I met at Jaina in 2009.  Our first conversation was about the Palm Treo - he had one!
  I was immediately intrigued.  The follow-on conversations about Richard Branson, Neckar Island and
  the Gmail 'lantern' (the Google Labs icon you used to see in Gmail), were perfect indications of
  Rishi's ability to carry on a conversation about ANYTHING which I felt was just perfect for me.
  We're truly lucky to have found each other and I can't wait for the years ahead!</div>

  <h3 class="story_heading">Our Proposal</h3>
  <div>
  Manisha and I got engaged on Saturday August 13th, 2011! I wanted to share with you one of my
  greatest successes - getting Manisha to marry me ;)</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <h4 class="story_heading">The Idea</h4>
  <div>
  Manisha is a big fan of treasure hunts, so I decided to create a fake scavenger hunt across San
  Francisco that incorporated her favorite things:
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px">
      <li>Her friends</li>
      <li>Smartphones (nerd alert!)</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Dancing</li>
      <li>Puzzles</li>
      <li>and Me! (I was hoping to find this out for sure)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3 class="story_heading">The 7 Step Plan</h3>

  height="634" /></a>
  <ol style="margin-left: 40px">
    <li>Build a website: <a href="http://www.sfhunt.com/" target="_blank">http://www.SFHunt.com</a> (see above)</li>
    <li>Have her friend Judy ask her to do the treasure hunt with her</li>
    <li>Make a smartphone based treasure hunt - each clue would be emailed to the team</li>
    <li>They will need at least 8 members to be on the team so "magically" all her close friends
    will also sign up (a few of mine too!)</li>
    <li>Each clue will be something very specific to Manisha, therefore she will
    be the only one that will be able to solve the clues easily. Think "Slumdog Millionaire for Manisha"</li>
    <li>The only way to get the next clue is if they email "The Company"
    (SFHunt) picture proof of the entire team solving the clue.</li>
    <li>The last clue will lead Manisha to me. I will be in a suit with an engagement ring
    and will propose to her then.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <h3 class="story_heading">How It Went Down</h3>
  <h4 class="story_heading">2 Weeks Before:</h4>
  <div>Judy invited Manisha to a treasure hunt via email. Literally one
  minute later, Manisha forwarded me and her friends the email and asked if
  we wanted to join in on the fun.</div>
  <div></div>
  <div><em>Success! The Plan was in motion. </em></div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <h4 class="story_heading">The Night Before:</h4>
  <div>I emailed the entire group from <a href="mailto:admin@sfhunt.com"
  target="_blank">admin@sfhunt.com</a> so it looked like a  real company and
  reminded the entire team to get ready.
  </div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <h4 class="story_heading">The Day Of THE TREASURE HUNT:</h4>
  <div>Everyone met up at Dolores Park at 10a (30 minutes before the
  Treasure Hunt began).  We got our first clue at 10:30 and the Hunt began!</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>Manisha was under the impression that "SF Hunt Admin" was sending out
  the clues, but really it was my friend Shalin who was sitting at a local
  Starbucks sending out pre-drafted emails.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>There were 6 clues total.  The first 5 were completed with all of us
  together as a team.  The great thing was that no one else knew the
  locations that the clues led to so even her friends were legitimately
  trying to solve each clue.  This definitely helped make the hunt more
  believable.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>Throughout the day, SF Hunt Admin would send us emails letting us
  know what place we were in!  Manisha was under the impression that there
  were 7 other teams competing.  After the first clue, our team was in 6th
  place... then 4th... then 3rd.  Everyone was getting excited about the
  possibility of winning and that was pumping Manisha up even more.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>The 6th clue had everyone split up into pairs.  Priya (Manisha's good
  friend from childhood) and Manisha had to go to the Palace of Fine Arts
  for their clue.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>While Priya and Manisha were heading towards The Palace of Fine
  Arts, my roommate Anish picked me up in his getaway car with my suit and
  drove me there as well.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>Priya did a great job delaying Manisha by stopping to use the
  restroom, taking some extra turns and driving slowly. This really helped
  me get in position for my final proposal.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>The last email said "Congrats!  Your team is currently in first
  place!  Send one person to the rotunda at Palace of Fine Arts to claim
  your prize".  At this point, Priya told Manisha to "Go Go Go!" and she
  started running to the rotunda.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <h3 class="story_heading">The Proposal</h3>
  <div>I was in a suit and Anish was ready with his camera.  Anish saw
  Manisha run into the rotunda and gave me a signal to go ahead.  I
  started playing music from my phone and ran in to give her a big
  hug.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>Manisha was SO SHOCKED to see me standing there in a suit.  I had
  to get her to stop jumping up and down for a second so that I could
  propose!  And she said yes.  :)</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>

  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>After a few minutes, Manisha's brother and all her friends came
  rushing out and we celebrated together.  THANKS to everyone who
  participated on that day - Anish, Judy, Andy, Ursula, Karishma, Priya,
  Robert, Shalin, Jamie, Sunil, Kaushal.</div>
  <div class="story_spacer"></div>
  <div>Special thanks to Anish Shah (my amazing roommate) for
  masterminding the entire operation. Also thanks to Manisha for saying
  yes :)</div>

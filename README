My first github project - my wedding website!

Deployment notes:
On linode server, in /home/app/modwsgi, there are two directories:
    env
    My-Wedding-Website

My-Wedding-Website is the git repo and env is the pyramid environment that apache invokes via modwsgi.  The process is as follows:

1) update code in My-Wedding-Website using a git pull
2) cd My-Wedding-Website/env
3) cp -r WeddingWebsite ../../env/  (overwrite the WeddingWebsite directory that was there before)
4) sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart (restart apache)
